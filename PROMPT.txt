i want a 9x9 grid on html canvas.  32x32px cells.  canvas id="canvas".   theres an animation loop that works for all frame rates.  two entities, a seeker and a target.  both are placed randomly.  the target moves randomly, realistically, according to a speed.  the seeker plots a path to the target.  this needs to be a very robust algorithm because eventually there will be 10 moving targets and 1000 seekers.  but for now just 1 and 1.  the seeker should calculate the path of tiles that will lead it to the target.  once it has that path, it should calculate a pixel perfect shortest route, meaning if its in open space for 3 tiles, it should cut a diagonal exactly to the soonest point it can make that turn, for example.  Instead of moving toward the first tile in the path, the seeker looks at the entire path and picks the furthest point it can see in a straight line.  seeker and target shouldnt move outside the bounds of the grid.
